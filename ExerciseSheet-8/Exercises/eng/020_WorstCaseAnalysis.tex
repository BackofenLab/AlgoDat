How many operations does (A) need in the worst case?
How many operations does (B) need in the worst case?
How many block operations does (A) need in the worst case?
How many block operations does (B) need in the worst case?
For your considerations use Quicksort for (A)
(as described in the last lecture) and universal hashing
(as described in lecture 5) for (B).
It is sufficient to give $\Theta (\dots)$.
Please state your opinion on which of the two procedures you think is faster in
practice and under which circumstances.
