Calculate the averaged runtime from exercise 2 for
$n = 2^{17}, 2^{18}, 2^{19}, 2^{20}, \dots$.
Increase $n$ as long as your computer can deal with the size and the computation
time is still bearable.
Generate a plot with the value of $n$ on the x-axis (logarithmic scale)
and a curve for the runtime of (A) as well as curve for the runtime of (B)
(different color).
