Given is the following recurrence relation:
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
a & \mbox{for } n\leq 2\\
T(\sqrt{n}) + a & \mbox{else}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Provide an expression for the runtime  $T(n)$ if the recurrence can be solved 
with the Master Theorem.
Hint: Find a suitable substitution for $\sqrt{n}$, such that the Master Theorem 
can be used.
