A recursive algorithm has the cost of: 
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{for } n=1\\
4T(n/2) + n^2 & \mbox{else}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

Provide an expression for the runtime  $T(n)$ if the recurrence can be solved 
with the Master Theorem.
Write a program that proves experimentally that this algorithm satisfies the 
calculated time complexity.
