a) The accession of data structures is often directed by the following 
recursion:
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
a & \mbox{for } n=1\\
c + T (n/2) & \mbox{else}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

Proof that $T (n) = {\mathcal O}(\log n)$.

b) The following recursion is given:
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
a & \mbox{for } n=1\\
2T (n/2) + n^3 & \mbox{else}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Provide an expression for the runtime  $T(n)$ if the recurrence can be solved 
with the Master Theorem.
