\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Calculate the runtime of both methods from the first exercise by creating a function \textit{compare\_runtimes}.
	Run both methods 5 times and compute the average execution time. Make sure not to use the previously sorted list when running conducting your test.
	
	\item
	Discuss your results regarding the runtime difference. 
	What are your expectations? \\
	Which algorithm is faster and why do you think this is the case?
\end{enumerate}
