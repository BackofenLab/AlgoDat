\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Calculate the runtimes of the four functions from the first exercise by implementing the \textit{measure\_runtimes\_top\_count()} and \textit{measure\_runtimes\_top\_x\_count()} functions in the template.
	Inside run each function 5 times and report the average runtime for each of the four functions. Make sure not to use a previously sorted list when repeatedly running the functions.
	
	\item
	Discuss your results regarding the runtime difference. Compare the two approaches (sorted list vs. hashing) as well as the top\_count vs. top\_x\_count versions of both approaches.
	What are your expectations? \\
	Which algorithm is faster and why do you think this is the case?
\end{enumerate}
