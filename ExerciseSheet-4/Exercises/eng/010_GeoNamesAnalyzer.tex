\exercise{1} \points{15}\\
Write a class \textit{GeoNamesAnalyzer} with the following methods:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    A method \textit{readInfoFromFile} to get the described information from
    the \textit{GeoNames.org} tab-separated table file \textit{allCountries.txt}
    which you can find on our website.
    All lines in the file with a P in column 7 are localities.
    You can find the locality names in column 2.
    Only consider localities with inhabitants (column 15).
    You can find the country code in column 9.
  \item
    A method \textit{computeMostFrequentCityNamesUsingSorting} which
    calculates the most-frequent world-wide locality names via sorting.
  \item
    A method \textit{computeMostFrequentCityNamesUsingMap} which does the
    same, but instead of sorting via the usage of associative arrays.
    Write one unit test for each of the two compute\ldots methods.
    Do not use the \textit{allCountries.txt} file for testing,
    but instead generate a small table with your program
    (or simply use the Linux command line for generating a test table).
    
    \textbf{ATTENTION}: Do not upload the \textit{allCountries.txt} file into
    the SVN directory!
\end{enumerate}
