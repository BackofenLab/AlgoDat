\exercise{1} Insertion Sort \points{10}\\
Implement the \textit{insertion-sort} algorithm.
The algorithm takes the first element of the unsorted list and inserts it in
the correct place of the sorted list.
All elements with a higher index than the inserted element have to be
reallocated.
For a graphical example look at
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion\_sort}.
Write at least one test for each method.
Each test should proof at least one nontrivial example.
Try if the algorithm works with an even and an uneven number of elements.
If there are critical cases which can be easily proven,
like the behavior of the method while having an empty input list,
proof them also.
