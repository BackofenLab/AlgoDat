Commit your solutions via svn inside a new subfolder

For the second exercise, commit your solution in PDF format in a subfolder named "\textit{non-code}".
Please also commit a text file \textit{erfahrungen.txt} into the folder. In there describe your experience with the exercise sheet in a few sentences:
Was it manageable for you?
How much time did it take you?
Did you have problems with specific parts?
