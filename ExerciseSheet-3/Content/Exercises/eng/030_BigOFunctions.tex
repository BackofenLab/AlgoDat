Order the following functions $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5$ according to their
runtime complexity such that $f_i = \mathcal{O} (f_{i+1})$ holds for
$i = 1, 2, 3, 4$.
Also determine for which i $f_i = \Theta (f_{i+1})$ holds and for which not.
Justify your decisions, particularly for the $i$ cases where
$f_i = \Theta (f_{i+1})$ does not hold.
You can use the limit definition of $\mathcal{O}$ and $\Theta$ for all your
justifications.\\
