Argue that the propositions in Exercise 1 do not only hold for $\log_2$,
but in the general case $\log_b$ for any single given $b > 1$ that does not
depend on $n$.
Remark: That is why in runtime analyses you often find $\log$ written without
the base.
Why is it important that $b > 1$? Describe what happens if $b = 1$ or $b < 1$.
Why is it important that $b$ does not depend on $n$?
Give an example where $b$ does depend on $n$ and one of the propositions
above does not hold anymore (you can choose which one you want to use).
