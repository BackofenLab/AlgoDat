Show that $\log_2 n = \mathcal{O}(n)$ holds.
Directly use the definition of $\mathcal{O}$ by determining $n_0$ and $C$ such
that $\log_2 n \leq C \cdot n$ holds for all $n \geq n_0$.

Show that $\log_2 n = \Omega (n)$ does not hold.
Directly use the definition of $\Omega$ by showing that for each given $C > 0$
and $n_0$ there exists a $n \geq n_0$ which violates the definition of
$\Omega$ (i.e. that $\log_2 n \leq C \cdot n$).
Consider also that $C$ can be smaller than 1.
