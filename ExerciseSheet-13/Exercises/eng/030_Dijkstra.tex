\exercise{2} \points{10} \textit{Dijkstra's Algorithm}\\
Extend the \emph{Graph} class with the method \emph{compute\_shortest\_paths()}.
This method will use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the
cost of all shortest paths from a given node to all reachable nodes.

For this make use of the variable \emph{costs} that is saved in the class
\emph{Arc}. To calculate the shortest path extend your class \emph{Node} with the
member variable \emph{Arc traceback\_arc}, which stores the edge that was used to
calculate the lowest costs for this particular node (i.e., to reconstruct the shortest path).
