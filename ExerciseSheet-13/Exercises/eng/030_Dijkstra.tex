\exercise{2} \points{10} \textit{Dijkstra's Algorithm}\\
Extend the \texttt{Graph} class with the method \texttt{compute\_shortest\_paths()}.
This method will use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the cost of all shortest paths from a given node to all reachable nodes.
For this make use of the variable \texttt{costs} that is saved in the class \texttt{Arc}.
To calculate the shortest path extend your class \texttt{Node} with the member variable \texttt{traceback\_arc}, which stores the edge that was used to calculate the lowest costs for this particular node (i.e., to reconstruct the shortest path).
