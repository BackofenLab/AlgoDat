\exercise{2} \points{5}\\
Extend your class \emph{Graph} from the last exercise in the following way:

The class \emph{Arc} retrieves in addition the ID of the start node 
(\emph{tailNodeId}), the distance in meters  (\emph{distance}) and the maximal 
speed in km/h  (\emph{maxSpeed}):

{\small
	\begin{verbatim}
	class Arc {
	// PUBLIC MEMBERS
	int tailNodeId;
	int headNodeId;
	float cost;
	int distance;
	int maxSpeed;
	}
	\end{verbatim}
}

Adjust the method \emph{readFromFile()} accordingly.
Furthermore, implement the method  \emph{setArcCostToDistance()} that sets the 
\emph{cost} for all edges to \emph{distance} and an additional method 
\emph{setArcCostToTravelTime(int maxVehicleSpeed)} that sets for all edges the 
\emph{cost} to the expected traveling time \emph{min(maxVehicleSpeed, 
maxSpeed)}).
