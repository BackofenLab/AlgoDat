\exercise{1} \points{5} \textit{Largest Connected Component}\\
On the website you can find the \emph{graph.py} file containing the \emph{Graph}
class and some already implemented methods (e.g. for reading in the \emph{.graph}
file). Have a look at the already supplied functionalities. Based on these, implement
the method \emph{compute\_lcc} which calculates all connected components and marks
the nodes in the largest connected component (= those with the highest count of
marked nodes). For this you can utilize the already implemented method
\emph{compute\_reachable\_nodes} inside the class for the computation of reachable
nodes for a given node. Be aware that you might need to adapt the output of
the method for this exercise.
