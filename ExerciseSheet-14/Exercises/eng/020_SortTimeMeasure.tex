%Write a program \emph{ApproximateGrepMain} that returns for a given string $x$ 
%all lines $y$ from a file that fulfill $ED(|x|, |y|) \le \max\{|x|,|y|\} / 5$.
%(meaning: the longer the longest of both strings, the more errors are allowed)

%Find with your new program the most similar lines of the AOL Query log (linked 
%on the homepage) for the following three search terms 
%\emph{google},
%\emph{angelina jolie},
%\emph{united airlines}.
%For all three searches, please list the hit-count and the running time in the 
%table linked on the homepage.

%Warning: The AOL Query log contains many queries multiple times. Count only the 
%distinct hits.
%You can also use this to make your program more efficient. Just save results 
%for already seen queries.
