\exercise{2} \points{6}\\
Write a program that inserts the numbers $1, 2, 
\ldots, n$ in this order in a (at the beginning) empty 
\emph{BinarySearchTree}.

Next, insert in a (again, at the beginning) empty \emph{BinarySearchTree}
the same $n$ numbers in random order.

Measure the runtime and the depth of the tree for both cases (after each $n$ 
insertions) for $n = 2^{10}, 2^{11}, 2^{12},
\ldots$. Increase $n$ so that the runtime is still bearable on your machine. 
Shortly discuss the results in your \emph{erfahrungen.txt}.
