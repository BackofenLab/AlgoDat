Implement a class  \emph{BinarySearchTree} with a binary search tree, such that 
the keys are of type \emph{int} and the elements can be of any type. If you 
have any problems with \emph{Java-Generics} or \emph{C++ templates} you can use 
the type string for the elements.

You can find a proposed design concept of this class on your homepage.
Please note that only \emph{insert} (6 points) and \emph{lookup} (4 points), 
but not \emph{remove} needs to be implemented. This means that you can omit the 
doubly linked lists between the nodes in your tree.


As usual, write some (useful) tests for your methods. For this purpose write 
one \emph{toString} method (4 points). One method to test \emph{insert} and 
\emph{lookup} together during the construction of a non-trivial tree is 
sufficient. Please take care that every line of both functions is at least 
executed once, during the tests.
