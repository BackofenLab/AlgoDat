The programmer in your neighboring office has asked you for a formula to
calculate the increase factor $r$ needed for increasing the array size such
that on average (amortized) an \texttt{append()} operation does not exceed the
costs $k \cdot A$.
We have shown in the lecture that the costs for the increase factor
$r = \frac{3}{2}$ are $4 \cdot A$ (i.e. $k = 4$).
