Implement the method \textit{remove} which removes the last element from the
list analogous to the \textit{append} method from the lecture.
Scale down the underlying fixed-size array each time it is occupied less than
one third of its size.
A sequence of $n$ append / remove operations should have an amortized linear
runtime. The template makes use of a fixed-size integer array taken 
from Python's \textit{numPy} package. Thus you first have to install \textit{numPy} for Python 3 (if you haven't done so yet). You can do this e.g. directly on the command line by typing:

\texttt{sudo apt-get install python3-numpy}
