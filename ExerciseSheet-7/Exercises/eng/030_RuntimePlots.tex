Expand your implementation such that different tests can be selected by 
using a command line argument to set which test to execute. 
You can e.g. use Python's \textit{argparse} module for that.
Make the program produce an output which represents the accumulated runtime
for a sequence of $n$ operations.
You can plot your results e.g. with \textit{gnuplot} (see description below).

Implement the following tests:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[Test 1:]
    A sequence of 10 million \textit{append} operations starting with an empty
    array.
  \item[Test 2:]
    A sequence of 10 million \textit{remove} operations starting with an array
    containing 10 million elements.
  \item[Test 3:]
    A sequence of 10 million operations starting with an array containing 1
    million elements.
    The operations should start with \textit{append} and then alternate after
    each reallocation between \textit{append} and \textit{remove}.
  \item[Test 4:]
    Same as Test 3, but this time starting with \textit{remove}.
\end{itemize}
Generate runtime plots for all tests and commit them inside a subdirectory
\textit{non-code} as part of your solution into the SVN directory.
You can e.g. use \textit{gnuplot} for plotting the runtime.
Make your program generate a text file (e.g. "runtime.txt") or just redirect
the standard output of your program into the text file on the command line:

\texttt{python3 dynamic\_int\_array.py -{}-test 1 > runtime.txt}

The text file should have the following format:\\
\textit{<input size 1> <TAB> <runtime 1>}\\
\textit{<input size 2> <TAB> <runtime 2>}\\
...\\
\textit{<input size n> <TAB> <runtime n>}

Based on this file you can generate a plot with the following command:\\
\texttt{gnuplot -e "plot 'runtime.txt'; pause -1;"}

A window will subsequently pop up, containing the desired plot.
You can then store the plot e.g. in JPEG format.
For details on the used parameters please check gnuplotâ€™s man pages by
executing \enquote{\texttt{man gnuplot}} or have a look here:
