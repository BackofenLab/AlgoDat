Implement the method \textit{remove} which removes the last element from the
list analogous to the \textit{append} method from the lecture.
Scale down the underlying fixed-size array each time it is occupied less than
one third of its size.
A sequence of $n$ append / remove operations should have an amortized linear
runtime.
