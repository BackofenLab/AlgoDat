For real world applications you might need a dynamic array with constant
execution time (also in worst-case) for all operations.
In other words:
Huge data reallocations can strongly impair system performance and should
therefore be omitted.
Write a class \textit{WorstCaseConstantAccessTimeArray} containing the methods
\textit{append(int item)}, \textit{get(int index)} and
\textit{put(int index, int item)} to meet this requirement and generate a
runtime plot in your \textit{non-code} folder as described.

Hint:  Store your elements in up to two fixed-size arrays and start copying
values before the capacity of the smaller array is exhausted.
