Write a script \emph{LargestConnectedComponentMain}, which reads the linked 
street graph \emph{saarland.graph} on the homepage and calculates the biggest 
connected component. All one-way streets are already saved there as two 
directed edges. Fill in your results in the table linked on the homepage and 
specify: number of nodes in the original graph, number of nodes in the biggest 
connected component, and overall running time of your script.

Hint:

You have to enhance the stack size in Java to ensure the function of the 
recursive calls. Therefore start your script with:

\begin{verbatim}
java -jar -Xss1024k LargestConnectedComponentMain.jar
\end{verbatim}
