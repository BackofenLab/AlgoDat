    \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        Mathematical exercises mostly easy
      \item
        Programming exercise took more time, but still mostly manageable
      \item
        Python programming gradually gets more comfortable
      \item
        The first two problems were quite easy. I just wondered why it was stated to prove them with strong induction.

    Tipps:\\
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        Try and test small pieces, do not postpone the testing
      \item
        Try to first write (some) tests and then the code (Test Driven Development)\\
        $\rightarrow$ Proven to be more straight, faster, less time for debugging
      \item
        Python programming gradually gets more comfortable\\
        $\rightarrow$ Please use the forum such that everyone can participate and learn from each other
    \end{enumerate}
