Let $\|U\| = \lbrace 0,1,2,\dots,N-1 \rbrace$ be a universe of $\mathbf{N}$
potential keys, p a prime number $\geq \|U\|$ and m the size of the hash table.
We have seen in the lecture that the class of hash functions
\begin{math}
  H = \lbrace h_{a,b}: a \in \lbrace 1, \dots, p-1 \rbrace,
    b \in \lbrace 0, \dots, p-1 \rbrace\rbrace
\end{math}
with $h_{a,b}(x) = ((ax + b) mod p) mod m$ is $c$ universal.

In the following exercises you will write a program which demonstrates that
this property holds. The amount of code should be relatively minor this time.
Most importantly, you need to understand the concept of universality.
