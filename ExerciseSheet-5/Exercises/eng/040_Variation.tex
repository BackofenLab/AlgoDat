\exercise{4} \points{5}\\
Write a program which calculates the values described in exercise 3 for
$\|U\| = 100, \; m = 100, \; p = 101$ and $n = 1000$ randomly chosen key sets
of size $k = 20$.
Next simulate a non-universal hash function by choosing $p = 10$ and based on
this again calculate the values described in exercise 3.
Insert your calculated values into the linked table you can find on the course
website (following the insertion description provided).
Shortly explain as part of your feedback in \textit{erfahrungen.txt} whether
your results make sense and if so why.
