\exercise{4} \points{5}\\
Write a program which calculates the values described in exercise 3 for
$\|U\| = 100, \; m = 100, \; p = 101$ and $n = 1000$ randomly chosen key sets
of size $k = 20$.
Next simulate a non-universal hash function by choosing $p = 10$ and based on
this again calculate the values described in exercise 3.
Report your calculated values in your \textit{erfahrungen.txt} file. Also shortly 
explain whether your results make sense and if so why.
