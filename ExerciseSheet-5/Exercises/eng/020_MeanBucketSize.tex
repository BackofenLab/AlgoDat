Write a function \textit{mean\_bucket\_size} which,
given a set of keys $S$ and a hash function $h$,
calculates the \textit{mean bucket size} of $h$ applied on $S$.
The mean bucket size is the mean number of elements that you have to look at
in the bucket in order to find the wanted key.
Attention: For this you only have to average over the buckets with at least
one key (i.e. $\|S\|$ divided by the number of non-empty buckets).
Why?

\textbf{Hints:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the hash function as a class (\emph{class HashFunction}) with the member variables $a$, $b$, $p$ (the prime number), $u$ (universe size), $m$ (hash table size). Also implement a method $apply(x)$ (apply hash function specified above to a given key value and return hash table index) and a void method \emph{set\_random\_parameters()} (set random parameters for $a$ and $b$, no return value)
\item \emph{mean\_bucket\_size} gets a list of keys and a hash function object and returns the calculated mean bucket size
\end{itemize}
