Write a method \textit{meanBucketSize} which,
given a set of keys $S$ and a hash function $h$,
calculates the \textit{mean bucket size} of $h$ applied on $S$.
The mean bucket size is the mean number of elements that you have to look at
in the bucket in order to find the wanted key.
Attention: For this you only have to average over the buckets with at least
one key.
Why?
