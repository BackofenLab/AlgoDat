  \begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Time effort from manageable to not manageable at all

\item<2-> Complaints about Python, more programming examples needed\\
$\rightarrow$ Acknowledged, but remember last year people had to deal with Java / C++

\item<3-> Exercise sheet instructions confusing / not very helpful\\
$\rightarrow$ You are welcome to come up with your own implementation (e.g. use classes, other names). As long as you implement the required functionalities on your own (e.g. not relying on libraries) and test and document your code appropriately

\item<4-> For most using associative arrays (Python dictionary) tends to be a bit faster\\
$\rightarrow$ Sorting the dictionary also takes time, depending on heterogeneity of the data (e.g. lots of locality names with count of 1 require higher effort)
